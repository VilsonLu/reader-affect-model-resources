When I think about commenting on this book, I feel like saying that it's not the story that's the problem. It isn't. Louie Zamperini's life is amazing, and also full of tragedy that most people cannot imagine. But the writing of this book was so dry that the book dragged on. I could barely get through the whole thing, and it often felt slow in what probably should have been the most intense moments of the book.

I had never read any other books by Laura Hillenbrand before. After this book, I don't think I ever will. Her writing is dull, it reminds me almost of a textbook. I couldn't stand it. I kept trying to like this book, but I couldn't. It did get better at around part three or so, but this is most certainly not a book I would read again. I'd rather read Devil at My Heels, personally.
