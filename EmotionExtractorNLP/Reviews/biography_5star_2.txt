I've just finished this awesome book, and have since washed the tears from my face. I can't hope to write a coherent review (there are so many good ones already written), so I'll just jot a few thoughts down:

* This is why I love non-fiction.

* Best book (by far) I've read this year.

* Every positive cliche adjective should be applied to this story.

* 5 stars isn't enough.

* If it was fiction, you wouldn't believe it.

* Go buy yourself a cloth hankie, 'cause a kleenex ain't gonna cut it by the last chapter.

* Makes me wish my dad was still around so I could ask him about the war.

* My next book is going to SUCK in comparison (might as well re-read Breaking Dawn then).

* Read this great review by my GR friend Amy S: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...
(her review made me want to read this book - great job Amy!)

* Perfect book to wrap up on Memorial Day, 2012:
To those who served, to those who still serve, to those who made it back, to those who didn't, to those who still suffer in ways we cannot imagine, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
