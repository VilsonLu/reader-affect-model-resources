So far, I have found that this book is complete drivel. I don't understand the mass appeal to this novel, nor do I understand how it managed to go down in history as an amazing piece of America literature. This book has no plot, no point, and no real characters. 

The characters in this book are one dimensional and painfully drab. They all seem to have the same personality with a few minor differences, and all that does is create boring dialogue and an uninteresting point of view. Harper Lee may be talented with using advanced vocabulary, but that does not make her a good writer. 

There is no conflict in this book. There's no personality. There's nothing interesting that compels me to read more. 

I'm fairly far into the book, and yet I still have no idea what it is about. If I could rate this book no stars, I would do so. This book is a necessary read for my honors English class, but if I could get away with not reading it I would do it without a bit of hesitation. 

As soon as I am done with this sorry excuse for a book, I am either going to tend to my fireplace using the pages as kindling or stash this book in the far corners of my basement where it will live out the rest of its days in darkness. I am not afraid to say with all honesty that this is possibly one of the most terrible wastes of paper I have ever laid eyes on.
