dan brown syndrome.

description

which is to say, this guy has a knack for a compelling idea, but his writing is...

hoo, boy.

just... brutal.

no soul. 

no poetry. 

all the verve of a dead body.

or a software engineer... 

description

just kidding, my gorgeous software-engineer-buddies: i was teasing the author, who is one of you, not you in particular or, y'know, in general, please don't hex my laptop because you are my everything, all i want for christmas is you, i can't live if living is without you.

*winsome smile*

but yeah, i'll give you a quick example: 

look at that cover.

look at how evocative it is. how it speaks of being caught up in a great rushing torrent of powers beyond your control. how it speaks of being marooned. 

how it speaks of being alone.

welp, this book is just like that, except without any of the things i just described.

the man doesn't even get around to really describing what mars looks like until somewhere after the 68 percent mark.

mars!!!

one of the most romantic planets in our solar system! 

description

weir's not havin' it.

ain't nobody got time fo scene-setting or sensory input; let's learn about air scrubbers, hilariously inexpensive celestial transport*, and potato farming, instead.

but still. 

the story—the bones of it, the structure, the plot—great fun.

and i love a good macguyver arc, not trynna lie.

it's good stuff.

just, like... 

not-especially well-written, is all.

naturally, the film is spectacular.

*seriously. i was so annoyed by how cheap everything was i went on an imessage rampage pointing out which terrestrial american aircraft cost ten times as much as the surely trillion dollar mars-to-orbit craft weir prices like he's the home shopping network. $200 million sounds like a lot, until you find out that there's a piece of software running the windscreen wipers on a b2 stealth bomber that costs more than andy weir's entire spacecraft.

aaaaaaand for the nitty-gritty of where i thought this novel failed as a novel, which i chose to express in catty gifs instead of catty words as usual, go read this guy. he says what i would have said if i weren't so anxious to go read queer avengers fanfic right now.
