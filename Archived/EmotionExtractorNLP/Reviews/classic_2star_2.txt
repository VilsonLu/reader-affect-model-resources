Spoilers

I really didn't enjoy this. None of it worked for me — the story for the most part was boring and predictable, the main characters were dull and cliched, and the narrative style wasn't to my liking. The first third was so slow, all Scout did was bang on about Boo Radley and the mystery surrounding him… Which could have been interesting if Scout hadn't been such a dull narrator. I hated her character, her home life, her family, and everything about her — her brother was an annoying douche, her dad and housekeeper were stereotypical, and her little adventures were so cheesy.
I was more interested in Boo Radley, Tom Robinson, and Mayella Ewell — their lives seemed a lot more interesting than Scout's.
Why did Scout/Jem always call their dad by his first name? It was a bit weird.
All in all, I wasn't impressed, but I'm glad I read it just so I can stop wondering if it's any good.
