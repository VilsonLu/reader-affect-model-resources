Look, this book is beautifully written. It's about a circus. The sentences bring a magical atmosphere which is quite stunning. Also, it's about a circus - it's about a circus and how the circus tents are colored. Black and white. But not the average black and white, mind you! Black and white. Or is it yellow and grey? 

But, really, Erin Morgenstern knows how to write for sure. The plot, though? It's about a circus - but not any kind of circus - it's a magical circus. I know, right? Astounding. I hope you really really really want to know this circus, that you crave for it, that you can't breathe until you know every fucking detail about this circus. How they perform in the circus! What they eat! What they wear! Oh, and the lights! 

Who are they, you're asking? Irrelevant. It's like asking who are the main characters and what exactly is their purpose. Oh, wait - it should matter right?

*frowns* 

Of course not! It's about a circus and many characters whose names I can't recall.

"Everything was magical. And it seemed to go on forever."

That's the thing! Too bad I love my books with a plot and characters I can connect with. I'm such a whiny reader. 

Really, though? If I wanted to read pages and pages of irrelevant descriptions, I'd reread Proust. At least I know where the story goes.
