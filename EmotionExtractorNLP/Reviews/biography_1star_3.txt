Too long ; needs better editing. For example, the time spent on the raft is just too long and drawn out. 

I have a very hard time believing some of the events: [the numerous Japanese bullets missed Allan Phillips and Max on the raft and fixing the bullet holes in the raft while they remained in it is implausible! (hide spoiler)] The sharks’ behavior seems unbelievable too…. The crews on the airplanes were given fleece clothing when they left for their first air assignment. Did there really exist fleece clothing back in the forties?! OK, the old woolen fleece garments is what is being referred to. I just cannot believe many statements made in this book! Louis’ behavior as a child seems very much “exaggerated”. 

Neither does the religious message professed in this book work for me. That Louis falls under the spell of Billy Graham put me off. 

I much preferred The Forgotten Highlander: My Incredible Story Of Survival During The War In The Far East. And my husband concurs; he too has read both books. Obviously my husband and I are in the minority, since so many others have loved this book!

An author should question what she is being told before writing a biography.
