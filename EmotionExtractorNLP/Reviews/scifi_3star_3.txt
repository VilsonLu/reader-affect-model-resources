3.5 stars

I enjoyed this story for what it was, a man too sarcastic for his own good trying to survive on Mars. I liked the diary format of it, and the audiobook was an incredible experience. However, this book just went completely over my head for the most part. It is literally rocket science. Mark describes things that happen to him like it's sooo relatable and that narration just didn't work because it was so scientific to the point that I was getting bored hearing him explain everything he does. Also, although I liked the tidbits of humor added to this, it seemed unrealistic at some points. He never has a breakdown of "holy shit i'm alone on mars," he just kinda embraces it with humor and trudges on, which I guess an astronaut is trained to do, but I still feel like a lot of Mark's emotions in this book were covered up by his attempts to be funny, which took away from the reader being able to see his vulnerability. (Or, again, maybe I would have just liked to see this because I am terrified of outer space.) But Andy Weir was great at crafting an entertaining story and MAJOR props to him for all the research that must have gone into this. It is absolutely packed with math and statistics that I wouldn't even know where to begin researching for, and even though it takes place on Mars in a situation that most likely no one will ever find themselves in this century, Weir was able to make it seem eerily real.
